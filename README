freeShazam 0.3
--------------
This is an implementation of the fast audio identification algorithm design by Shazam.  
We use a similar technique, but only use FOSS libraries and tools to get the work done.


How it Works 
------------
freeShazam is composed by a set of tools for spectrogram analysis, fingerprinting, storage and fast retrieval:

1. Transform music spectrograms into matrices
2. Analyze matrices, storing its 'fingerprint' and generating unique hash numbers
3. Use stored fingerprints and use them for music identifcation


Requirements
------------
Before you install, make sure you have met the dependencies:

Gstreamer0.10 and its plugins (for the 'good' set)
Linux 2.6.x (might work under other Unix-flavored systems, but not tested)
Apache2
MySQL
R-base
Sound package for R
PHP5


How to Install
--------------
There is no tarball distribution at this moment, so grab the source code from our Git repository:

git clone git://github.com/unixjazz/free_shazam.git

After making a local copy of freeShazam, place the directory in your Apache public directory (must sit around /var/www/ or something).
To generate the SQL database structure, use the free_shazam.sql file, located at db/
Also, set the user/passwd of your MySQL on the file: 'db_connector.php'
